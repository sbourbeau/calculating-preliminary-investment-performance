I created this program to calculate investment performance for a client holding and ready it for upload directly into Paris, a portfolio accounting tool used by investment consultants. 
Paris doesn't natively allow automated performance calculations based on investment vehicle performance, which means performance needs to be manually keyed into a Paris field and the value needs to be manually calculated by an analyst each time. To get around this, I developed a process with Quick Base to house investment vehicle performance data; export that data with the corresponding investment holding; calculate the estimated value in Python; and spit out a CSV in the proper upload format for Paris. The CSV output is then imported into Paris, directly updating the performance amount; calculated value; and date.
Typically, investment performance is needed when a client executive summary is due before a final value is available, but when performance estimates for the fund are available. In our case, we have approximately 3,000 holdings that would benefit from a process like this to be automated on a monthly basis. That translates to about 4% of the analysts overall time spent on this task. By automating it, I've estimated a time savings of 1,359.37 hours per year.
